An unusual new currency, where there is just one unit, which people mine, buy and sell shares in.

It can be thought of like a company, which has shares. 
The coin, of which there is only one, could have a value of £200, for example.

A miner, named Alice, could mine a share of 0.0100000000000, which would give them £2. 
Another miner, Bob, could mine a share of 0.0025000000000, which would give him 50p.

Share mining difficulty increases relatively slowly, which gives each individual share slightly more value.
[as the extra "money" - rather, mining power, which is thought of as money, is divided proportional to the shares]

So, Alice's share could become worth £2.50, while Bob's could become worth 62.5p.

There are one trillion [1,000,000,000,000] shares up for grabs [and in theory more].
Shares have renewal/expiry dates, to create a dynamic, moving currency.

It encourages mining, as well as competitivity.

Note: When buying, you sell a bit of your share in return for a product you want. If you wait, you will be gambling, without knowing if the currency will fall, or increase. Be sensible with the currency.
